This software enables users to develop, compile, and download code for Machine
Science's PIC- and ATmega-based microcontroller platforms without access to the
Internet. The user interface is identical to that of the web-based Programming
Window, which is available on-line at guides.machinescience.org. Note that the
on-line version may offer new features not included in this release.

To compile code for PIC-based platforms, you must install the HiTech PICCLite
Compiler. To install the compiler, run the picclite-setup.exe executable file
contained in this folder. (Click "No" when asked if you want to install the MPLAB 6
PICC Lite Toolsuite Plugin.)

To compile code for the ATmega-based platforms, you must install the WinAVR GCC
compiler, which is available here:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/winavr/files/WinAVR/ Download the most recent WinAVR
package and follow the installation instructions.

In either case, you must have a recent version of Java installed. To install Java,
go to http://java.com/en/ and click the "Free Java Download" button.

To launch the software, open the Coder.html file in a Java-enabled web browser. Code
files are saved in the folder called "Code". We recommend using Firefox or Internet
Explorer.
